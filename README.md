# Final Currency Converter App

## Requirements

1. A list showing exchange rates for a base currency against a list of currencies:
    1. User can change the base currency, and the list of rates will be updated.
    2. You can either use a drop down menu or a list of links to implement the base currency selection feature. It is up to you, but make sure it's intuitive.
2. A currency converter for a pair of currency, where the user can:
    1. Edit the amount to be converted. Either allow user to swap the direction of the currency pair, or allow amounts on both sides to be edited.
    2. Allow the user to change the currencies being calculated. Using a drop down menu or other means you think is intuitive.

    2. ~~Anchor links if you are going to have multiple pages.~~
4. Has a footer:
    1. Link to your portfolio site or social media accounts.
    2. ~~It needs to be responsive, which means it can be easily used on a mobile browser as well!~~
5. ~~Version managed with Git, and has a GitHub repository.~~
6. ~~You need to deploy the production build either onto Netlify or Heroku (Heroku preferred).~~
